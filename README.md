</a>
Z-Wave rotary dimmer for different light sources. The LED dimmer dims at low load without the light flickering. Dimmer LED from 1-200VA, 230V halogen and incandescent bulbs, dimmable LED drivers and electronic transformers. Not affected by additional starting currents. Need L + N conductor connected.

The dimmer has end-turn function. This allows you to turn on the light and dimming with one dimmer, and then turn off the light with another dimmer. Convenient for example in stairs and corridors.

The dimmer fits into standard Elko, Schneider Exxact and Gira System 55 frame systems.

v2.3.0 (BETA), Homey SW ≥2.4.0
* Fix S2 security handshake issues with Z-TRM2fx, Z-water and Z-Relay that result in Z-wave network stability issues by forcing non-secure inclusion.
   * All users experiencing stability issues with the Z-TRM2fx, Z-Water and Z-Relay devices are advised to upgrade to v2.3.0 and remove and re-include their devices based on the v2.3.0 version   
* Removed Homey 1.x.x mobile interface (obsolete)   
* Add insights logging for the Thermostat state capability

v2.2.1
* Fix issue not being able to include the Heatit Z-push button 2 and Z-push button 8 devices   
* Z-TRM2(fx) changed default temperature- and meter-reporting interval from 60 to 900 seconds to prevent Z-wave network lock-up    

v2.2.0
* Add support for the Heatit Z-relay device   
* Add support for the Heatit Z-DIN-616 device
* Update branding of the app    

v2.1.2 (BETA)
* Fix temperature reporting issues for Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92), Z-TRM2(fx) and Z-Water *(Homey SW 2.0.5+)*   
  *Note*: Please follow the steps mentioned below to fix the temperature reporting (only working as of Homey Software 2.0.5):
  * For already paired devices:   
      1. Go to advanced settings, and replace (add if not existing) Homey's ID `1` with `1.1` in the following association groups used for the temperature reporting:   
        * Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92): Group 3, 4 and 5   
        * Z-TRM2(fx): Group 2 and 3   
        * Z-Water: Group 11, 12, 13 and 14    
      2. For the thermostats, change in the Device specific settings (Sensor settings group), the 'Displayed temperature' to the sensor connected (default: floor sensor)   
      3. Save settings   
  * Alternative option is to remove and re-include the device based on the v2.1.2 version of the app   
* Add temperature changed flow cards for Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92), Z-TRM2(fx) and Z-Water
* Update to meshdriver v1.2.32   

v2.1.1 (BETA)
* Add support for the Z-Water regulator   
* Update to meshdriver v1.2.30   
* *Note*: due to an S2 issue within the Homey Z-wave core, the measured temperatures are not reported for the Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92) and Z-TRM2(fx) thermostats as well as the Z-Water regulator. When this will be resolved, it is likely that the thermostat will need to be re-included

* Add support for the Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92)    
* Add support for the Z-TRM2(fx) thermostat
* Add all remaining settings for the thermostats

* *Note*: due to an issue within the Homey Z-wave core, the measured temperatures are not reported for the Z-wave thermostat (FW 1.92) and the Z-TRM2(fx) thermostats. When this will be resolved, it is likely that the thermostat will need to be re-included
